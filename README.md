# A language timeline for mourning gun violence 
###Tracking the usage of words and phrases over time after a shooting event

Unfortunately gun violence is becoming a common occurrence in America and many people worry that we are becoming numb to the tragedy and our responses are becoming rote. I want to find out if that’s true, at least in the media.

I will track the frequency of certain terms in news stories. In addition to obvious terms such as “shooting” I want to look at term frequency for more culturally loaded terms such as “hopes and prayers”, “gun control”, and “mental illness”. I plan to see how those frequencies change over time in the weeks following an incident, as well as differences between types of incidences. This might answer, for instance, is there a specific lifecycle for the national conversation following a tragedy? Does the language of the conversation change depending on the race or religion of the shooter? 

I will use complete news stories from a Kaggle data set to find stories that were released in the weeks following a shooting. I will also use data on shootings from Mother Jones to find the date they occurred, as well as other contextual information about the attack. I will then perform term frequency analyses such as TF-IDF to find out how relevant terms of interest are. Finally I will compare the coverage for different events (e.g. religion of shooter) or try to find patterns in the timing of term usages (think days since the incident) using statistical tests and data visualization.
